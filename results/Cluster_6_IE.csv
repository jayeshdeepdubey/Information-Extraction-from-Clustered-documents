16086,How Change of Public Transportation Usage Reveals Fear of the SARS Virus in a City,"During the 2003 SARS period, we observed two significant relationships between the daily underground ridership and the daily reported SARS cases.",1
16087,How Change of Public Transportation Usage Reveals Fear of the SARS Virus in a City,"Firstly, there exists a quick response of the underground ridership with respect to the daily reported SARS cases that made headlines almost everyday in the mass media during the SARS period.",1
16089,How Change of Public Transportation Usage Reveals Fear of the SARS Virus in a City,The public fear of contacting the SARS virus during the use of the underground system vividly reflected in the significant drops of underground ridership.,1

16161,How Change of Public Transportation Usage Reveals Fear of the SARS Virus in a City,"These results indicate that, if the time scales of public perception to each reported SARS case are the same, then the impact on the loss of underground passengers will be limited to the days close to the peak of the reported SARS cases.",1

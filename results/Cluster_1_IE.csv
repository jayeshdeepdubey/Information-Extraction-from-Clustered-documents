4650,Adaptation of novel H7N9 influenza A virus to human receptors,The relative inability of the human N9 protein to remove a2-6 SIA residues may negatively affect the ability of the H7N9 virus to obtain more efficient binding to these human-like receptors as efficient replication of such viruses probably requires adaptive mutations in the NA protein.,1

7511,Human avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in China,"There are at least three requirements for the emergence of a pandemic virus, which including a novel HA and possibly NA subtype, lack of prior immunity in the human population, and the capacity for efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission.",1
7517,Human avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in China,The second mechanism is through reassortment with current circulating human influenza viruses such as H1N1 or H3N2 virus.,1
7518,Human avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in China,Such reassortment may occur in human or in intermediate host such as pigs.,1
7531,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"Rarely, one of these viruses undergoes changes that enable it to switch hosts to infect mammals, including humans, although it is not clear whether human transmission can result directly from adaptation of an avian influenza virus , or only indirectly via further adaptation of pre-existing human or mammalian-adapted viruses, the mechanism that has been associated with all known pandemic and seasonal viruses after 1918.",1
7533,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"In the past 80 years of influenza virology, three pandemics have resulted from reassortments of pre-existing human-adapted or mammalian-adapted viruses with one or more avian-influenza-derived genes, but no purely avian influenza virus has emerged to cause a pandemic or human outbreak, or has even become stably adapted to humans.",1
7535,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"Among many other important research areas related to influenza, it is therefore critical to study the mechanisms by which influenza viruses emerge from birds to become adapted to mammals and ultimately humans, and to learn how the phenotypic properties of such evolving viruses may be associated with human transmission and disease.",1
7538,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"In seeking to understand such influenza viruses, a research approach used widely in virology is to engineer specific genetic mutations into naturally occurring viruses, and then study the resulting viral phenotypic properties in animals, including infectivity, cell tropism, viral replication, pathogenicity and transmissibility.",1

7548,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"Therefore, despite the current unusual situation with H5N1 viruses in humans since 2003 , neither H5N1 nor other HPAI viruses would necessarily replicate systemically or cause extreme pathogenicity should human adaptation occur.",1
7549,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"Although the basis of HPAI H5N1 viral pathogenicity in severe and fatal human cases remains unknown, there is no evidence suggesting that it results from changes known to be associated with viral adaptation to gallinaceous poultry; in fact, no human-adapted or pandemic influenza virus contains genetic changes indicative of prior poultry adaptation.",1
7558,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,It may be that the human cases are a result of unusual high-dose exposures or rare individual genetic susceptibilities.,1
7562,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"Even when avian influenza virus genes have been imported by reassortment into existing human influenza viruses, as happened for example in 1957 with H2N2 influenza and in 1968 with H3N2 influenza, the sources seem to have been circulating low-pathogenicity avian viruses, not poultry-adapted viruses such as HPAI viruses 10 .",1
7564,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"After 15 years of highdensity enzootic circulation in domestic poultry around the world, no human-adapted H5N1 virus has emerged from a natural reservoir, suggesting the existence of unknown biological barriers.",1
7566,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"Decades ago, many experts predicted that influenza pandemics could be explained by arecycling' of a small number of HAs in new human generations; more recently, this belief has been expanded to posit that the other HA subtypes are fundamentally incapable of adapting to humans, being selected against by biological constraints or unappreciated selection pressures .",1
7567,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"Despite widespread influenza virus circulation and dynamic evolution at the human-animal interface, with many billions of quasispecies, mutations and gene constellations circulating, only four influenza pandemics have occurred in the last century, and in the three of those with a known viral origin the viruses resulted from reassortment of pre-existing human or swine viruses 21 , not by mutation or adaptation of existing avian viruses.",1
7568,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"This suggests that de novo emergence of a human pandemic influenza virus is an extremely rare event that is not easily achieved in nature 10 , and presumably would not be easily achieved by engineering a small number of laboratory mutations.",1

7577,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"Thus, pathogenicity and transmissibility of any influenza virus in ferrets cannot be used directly to predict what type and severity of disease the same virus might produce in humans and human populations.",1
7578,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,It is unclear whether genetic manipulation of an H5N1 virus to achieve transmissibility in a particular mammal such as a ferret can predict human transmissibility.,1
7579,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"Because natural history and viral challenge studies cannot always be performed in humans, they have been conducted in experimental animals including mice, guinea pigs, ferrets, non-human primates and various other mammals.",1

7581,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"Unlike most other mammals, ferrets generally can be infected with many or most avian, mammalian and human influenza viruses without prior viral adaptation, and often transmit efficiently between them 35 , providing useful general information about the viral genetic basis of phenotypic properties such as infectivity, pathogenicity, transmissibility and immune responses 35 , even though the findings cannot necessarily be directly applied to human infections .",1
7584,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"Specifically, many naturally occurring influenza viruses that infect, and often transmit between, ferrets are not known to infect people or cause human disease 27, 39, 40 .",1
7585,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"Ferrets are thus an imperfect model for predicting human infectivity or transmissibility, let alone the high level of transmissibility characteristic of pandemic spread.",1
7586,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"On the basis of public presentations by the senior authors of the two studies in question, neither of the engineered H5N1 viruses was as efficiently transmissible in ferrets as the human-adapted 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus 14, 15 .",1
7587,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"Phenotypic properties such as replication, pathogenicity and transmissibility are likely to be polygenic traits driven by mutations that are independent and possibly competing 10, 41 .",1
7592,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"Moreover, because determinants of viral pathogenicity may be lost upon adaptation to a new host, H5N1 viruses, whether or not transmissible, do not always cause severe disease in ferrets or non-human primates .",1
7594,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"Indeed, given that many influenza viruses that are non-pathogenic for humans easily transmit and may cause illness in ferrets, the 'ferret model' does not reliably predict human transmissibility or pathogenicity, although the model remains valuable for understanding the principles and dynamics of infection.",1
7596,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"Although swine influenza viruses caused sporadic human infections before 2009 49, 50 , and caused the 2009 H1N1 pandemic 21 , outbreaks associated with human influenza viruses are rare in pigs.",1
7607,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"However, potentially more important clues to actual H5N1 pathogenicity and human casefatality rates come from epidemiological studies, which taken together suggest to us that H5N1 may not be highly lethal except in people with rare susceptibilities.",1
7610,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"When such information is considered in light of statistically significant clustering of non-human-transmitted household cases in genetically related versus unrelated persons 57,58 , a reasonable explanation seems to us to be that H5N1 is so poorly adapted to humans that exposure does not normally lead to infection or even the development of a detectable immune response 57, 59 , except in persons with specific but undefined genetic susceptibilities, many of whom become cases .",1
7611,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"There are few data on what the basis of such genetic susceptibilities may be, although recent evidence has linked severe human influenza to a minor IFITM3 allele 63 , supporting the suspicion that genetic determinants of influenza infection and replication in humans do exist.",1
7614,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"On the other hand, rapid disappearance of human H5N1 vaccineinduced antibody 64 suggests that the opposite problem of false negatives could be occurring and, if so, might be especially problematic in cross-sectional studies in which the time since infection is not known, and which could in some cases be long enough for antibody titres to wane to sub-threshold or undetectable levels.",1
7620,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"Like other poorly adapted viruses that rarely infect humans 34 , the H5N1 virus may simply be productively infecting too few of the people exposed to it, even in situations of widespread human contact, leaving minimal immunological evidence of exposure at the population level, while at the same time 'finding' and infecting those occasional persons with unusual susceptibilities to it; that is, cases 59 .",1
7626,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"Such studies feature numerous pathogenicity-associated, and sometimes transmissibilityassociated, mutations affecting the HA-receptor-binding site, including changes that enhance receptor affinity for α2-6-linked sialic acid receptors, thought to be important for human adaptation 25, .",1
7649,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"If, as we believe existing data suggest, pathways to human adaptation are many, virus-specific, and with few common denominators, it will be important to study not just H5N1 but a wide range of avian and mammalian-and human-adapted viruses, including studies that feature backward genetic engineering to remove phenotypic determinants of adaptation, studies in nonhuman primates and, when safe and appropriate to do so, in human challenge studies 88 .",1

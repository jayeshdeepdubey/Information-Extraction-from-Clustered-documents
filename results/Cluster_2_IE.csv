2196,Mechanistic and topological explanations in medicine: the case of medical genetics and network medicine,"To explain this surprising result, the researchers made an evolutionary hypothesis: the vast majority of human disease genes are non-essential and centered at the periphery of the interactome because, when mutated, they only lead to disease instead of leading to death in utero.",1
2242,Mechanistic and topological explanations in medicine: the case of medical genetics and network medicine,"For example, the local hypothesis, according to which genes and gene products that are involved in the same disease have an increased tendency to interact together and to belong to the same disease module, depends highly both on a topological property of the diseasome and on mechanistic information on the human disease genes represented in the diseasome .",1
2243,Mechanistic and topological explanations in medicine: the case of medical genetics and network medicine,"In a similar way, interpreting the degree of essentiality-centrality of human diseases genes is also highly dependent on the import of external mechanistic information on the systematic knockout of their murin orthologues.",1
2247,Mechanistic and topological explanations in medicine: the case of medical genetics and network medicine,"First, we may wonder why the diseasome has such topological properties, how it has evolved to be a scale-free network, why some functional disease modules are more robust than others to external perturbations and why the human disease genes are mostly at the periphery of the interactome.",1
2248,Mechanistic and topological explanations in medicine: the case of medical genetics and network medicine,"I have mentioned some evolutionary hypotheses about this last point: human disease genes would be located at the periphery of the interactome, because their mutations do not lead to death in utero.",1
2269,Mechanistic and topological explanations in medicine: the case of medical genetics and network medicine,"By relying on the topological properties of the human disease gene network, network medicine provides an explanation of the common genetic origin of diseases, reinterprets the concept of genetic diseases through the identification of disease modules and explains the difference between monogenic and polygenic diseases as a matter of functional redundancy and robustness.",1

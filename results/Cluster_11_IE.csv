5941,Coronavirus immunogens,Enteric infections induce immune responses which are protective at respiratory mucosal surfaces.,1
5947,Coronavirus immunogens,"At present, the potency of live coronavirus vaccines is assessed by in vitro titration of the viral infectious dose in cell culture.",1
5958,Coronavirus immunogens,A variety of expression systems have been developed for the production of coronavirus antigens.,1
5959,Coronavirus immunogens,"Because the coronavirus S protein is glycosylated, eucaryotic expression systems were used to obtain recombinant proteins.",1
5962,Coronavirus immunogens,"In general, parenteral or oral administration of soluble proteins induces poor mucosal immune responses or results in tolerance induction .",1
5963,Coronavirus immunogens,Therefore oral administration of subunit coronavirus vaccines will require new mucosal adjuvants and delivery systems to stimulate mucosal immunity.,1
5975,Coronavirus immunogens,Attenuated adenoviruses exist in other species which might also be developed for live rDNA vectors permitting expression of the coronavirus gene inserts in the intestine.,1
5977,Coronavirus immunogens,"Although only in the early stages of development, such live rDNA vectors may play a key role in the generation of future coronavirus vaccines.",1

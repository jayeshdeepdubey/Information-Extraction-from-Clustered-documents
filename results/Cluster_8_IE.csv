3844,A canine model of experimental infection with Leishmania (L.) mexicana,"This change in immune profile would explain the initial control of the lesion leading to its healing, as well as the failure of the immune system to achieve parasite elimination, allowing the detection of Leishmania parasite DNA in the healed lesion and lymph nodes.",1

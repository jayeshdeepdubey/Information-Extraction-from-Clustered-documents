1263,The Coronavirus E Protein: Assembly and Beyond,"More recently, an untagged version of SARS CoV E was shown to largely adopt an N exo C cyto topology in infected cells and in cells transiently expressing the protein .",1
1271,The Coronavirus E Protein: Assembly and Beyond,"If CoV E is inserted into the membrane both in a transmembrane and membrane hairpin orientation, one question that arises is how a single protein might adopt multiple topologies.",1

Understanding how the E proteins from different CoVs vary is a crucial step in elucidating the mechanism of CoV assembly and egress.",1
1309,The Coronavirus E Protein: Assembly and Beyond,The ability of the different CoV E proteins to rescue the E deletions of other CoVs should be tested much the same way as they were for MHV .,1
1310,The Coronavirus E Protein: Assembly and Beyond,"In addition, membrane associated accessory proteins from different CoVs should be examined in this same assay to determine if any of them can substitute for E. Finally, the tandem-affinity approach used to identify interacting proteins for SARS-CoV should be extended to other CoVs.",1

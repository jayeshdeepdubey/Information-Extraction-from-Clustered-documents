16253,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,CT scans were obtained at one site only and were generally used to document early lung findings when the initial chest radiograph was normal or equivocal and suspicion for SARS was high.,1
16256,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,"For the Hong Kong patients , chest CT was used for patients with suspected SARS but with normal chest radiographs, patients with a moderate to severe clinical course of the disease, and patients without contact history.",1
16257,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,"Use of CT may be justified if management depends upon positive lung findings; however, suspect SARS patients were also admitted and managed in a similar fashion to those with positive chest radiograph findings.",1
16258,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,It is still unclear whether the infectivity of suspect SARS patients is similar to or decreased relative to those with positive radiographic findings.,1
16259,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,Radiography has two major roles in SARS.,1
16260,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,The first role is to recognize pulmonary disease in a patient with clinical symptoms of SARS and contact history but who may not have cough.,1
16262,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,It is important to differentiate SARS from other respiratory infection commonly encountered in children.,1
16264,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,"While its radiologic manifestations are nonspecific, SARS appears similar to other viral infections encountered in children.",1
16265,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,"Certain radiographic findings are uncommon in SARS, including extensive pleural effusions, pneumothorax, pneumatocele, and lung abscess.",1
16267,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,"Many patients were initially clinically thought to have tuberculosis or other infections, but the lack of radiographic findings such as adenopathy, cavitation, or pleural effusion may aid in suggesting SARS or assist in excluding other disorders.",1
16268,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,"Recognition of the presence of radiographic changes which are atypical for SARS, such as adenopathy and significant pleural effusion, may help to guide therapy as well as show the need for isolation.",1
16271,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,"Although the mechanisms of SARS transmission remain to be fully elucidated, the most likely route of transmission is by large droplet and contact .",1
16272,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,Data from Hong Kong have shown the potential of SARS-associated coronavirus to persist in stool or urine of SARS patients and maintain its viability on various contact surfaces for extended periods .,1
16275,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,"Further, the use of portable techniques in the ward, where a child can be maintained in proper isolation, helps to minimize the risk of SARS virus transmission to staff and other patients.",1
16280,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,"Other factors include failure to apply appropriate isolation precautions to known SARS cases or cases which have not yet been identified as SARS and, finally, infected workers continuing to work despite infection.",1
16281,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,It is possible that all respiratory infections at initial presentation will need to be regarded as potential SARS cases until proven otherwise.,1
16284,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,"At this point we cannot be sure that all cases were indeed SARS, and potentially other etiologies may have been included.",1
16286,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,"Community spread has not been identified in Toronto and Singapore; however, Hong Kong has encountered this problem at PWH and PMH where three RT-PCR confirmed SARS cases were reported without definite contact history.",1
16287,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,"Although standard nomenclature was used, other potential limitations of SARS diagnosis included the fact that we relied upon local interpretation of radiographs and review of radiology reports, which may be subject to some variation in interpretation of images.",1
16288,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,"In conclusion, SARS in children manifests with nonspecific radiographic features making radiological differentiation difficult, especially from other commonly encountered childhood respiratory viral illnesses causing airspace disease.",1
16289,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): chest radiographic features in children,"The radiographic presentation of suspect SARS cases ranged from normal or mild perihilar peribronchial thickening; however, the radiographic presentation, as expected, was relatively more pronounced in the probable SARS cases with airspace disease including ground-glass opacification and consolidation.",1

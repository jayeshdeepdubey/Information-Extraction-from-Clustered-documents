25861,Mini-Review A view from the Common Cold Unit,"Thus, after years of frustration the work of the Unit developed to the point where relevant human infections could be produced at will and precisely documented by clinical and laboratory methods -this was the ideal setting for preliminary trials of the efficacy of antiviral drugs or vaccines without which nowadays it would rarely be justifiable to go on to a field study of naturally acquired colds.",1
25864,Mini-Review A view from the Common Cold Unit,"Once we had even small amounts of human interferon we could show in vitro that it would render human cells resistant to a wide range of viruses capable of causing colds, but there was a general view that such treatment would never protect the respiratory epithelial cells, defended as they are by the mucociliary apparatus.",1
25866,Mini-Review A view from the Common Cold Unit,"Later chemically synthesized antivirals were also disappointing, but interferon experiments continued with purer and more potent preparations until 1973 when the idea of antivirais for the treatment of colds finally came of age and rhinovirus-induced colds were prevented at the Unit by spraying human leucocyte interferon intranasally .",1
25882,Mini-Review A view from the Common Cold Unit,Other experiments showed that human performance is impaired by colds and influenza and a start was made in looking for the role of virus-induced humoral factors such as interferon as mediators of these changes .,1

25968,Mini-Review A view from the Common Cold Unit,We have determined that human volunteers make antibodies against at least 3 such sites on rhinovirus type 2 identified by mouse monoclonal antibodies.,1
25974,Mini-Review A view from the Common Cold Unit,"It is now well known that exogenous interferon, delivered as a nasal spray, protects the human from both experimental and naturally acquired common colds .",1
25994,Mini-Review A view from the Common Cold Unit,"A thioguanosine derivative has been found which protects mice against coronavirus infection by enhancing their resistance and this has also been studied in volunteers using colds induced by a coronavirus; analysis indicates that either it was given in too low a dose, or that it does not enhance the primate response in the same way as that of the rodent .",1
26023,Mini-Review A view from the Common Cold Unit,"However, it has been known that they fall into only two groups as judged by their ability to infect cells in tissue cultures, namely those that can infect only human cells or those that can infect both monkey and human cells .",1
26033,Mini-Review A view from the Common Cold Unit,"It is therefore arguable that in the case of infections like coronavirus or rhinovirus colds, which are normally quickly self-limited, the best approach would be to relieve the patient is discomfort and disability and leave their immune system to take care of the virus.",1
26034,Mini-Review A view from the Common Cold Unit,"Furthermore in the case of viral and bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal tract, most of those that lead to diarrhoea are best handled by managing their physiological effects, usually by oral rehydration, while the immune system controls the infection.",1
26064,Mini-Review A view from the Common Cold Unit,"Nevertheless the human coronaviruses are now being explored at the molecular level, and infection with one serotype can already be diagnosed by the use of a nucleic acid probe .",1
26075,Mini-Review A view from the Common Cold Unit,Tests of human performance enable us to assess the isystemic' effects of the infection and the benefits of any treatment on this .,1
26076,Mini-Review A view from the Common Cold Unit,"All this technology will enhance the detail in which the clinical study of drug effects can be documented, but unless or until an effective animal model can be developed it is my belief that experiments in human volunteers will continue to play a key part in the development of specific antiviral therapies.",1
